Ranking-Trees Multicriteria Algorithm was originally published in a scientific research article:  
(https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/DTA-07-2020-0161/full/html)

This is a slightly modified version of the original Ranking Trees Algorithm, which now outputs the partial concordance matrix and the partial discordance matrix from the ELECTRE III Method.    
Clone this repository and keep the "electre" & "promethee" folders and "main.py" in the same directory.  
Also, keep the multicriteria dataset <matriz_criterios.csv> in the same directory, otherwise specify the path to your original multicriteria dataset file location on the loading dataset section in the file "ELECTRE_III_Research.ipynb".
